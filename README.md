Collected resources including databases and tools for linking protein functional sites (mutations, Posttranslational modifications, ligand-binding sites) and protein-protein interactions networks in the study of their functional roles in allostery transduction, or called “Allo-network”. For the detail resource, please see http://121.5.52.202/sitePPI/

This is an example of our idea of how to link mutational sites with protein-protein interaction network to study the genotype-phenotype relationships. We classify our method of sitePPI as network mapping, network scoring, and network perturbation.
